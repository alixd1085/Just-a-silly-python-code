# Just-a-silly-python-code-P
This is a code that i made combining most of the stuff that i learnt about python and made a little minigame there 
don't mind the huge number range i got a bit excited about it ðŸ˜…

Now i know that it's full of If statements but i'm just a beginner don't excpect me to understand looping and that stuff immedietly that code took me 5 hours to make because i don't know alot of python ;-;
